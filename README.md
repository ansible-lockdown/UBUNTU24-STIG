## Caution(s)

This role **will make changes to the system** which may have unintended consequences. This is not an auditing tool but rather a remediation tool to be used after an audit has been conducted.

- Testing is the most important thing you can do.

- Check Mode is not guaranteed! The role will complete in check mode without errors, but it is not supported and should be used with caution.

- This role was developed against a clean install of the Operating System. If you are implementing to an existing system please review this role for any site specific changes that are needed.

- To use release version please point to main branch and relevant release for the STIG benchmark you wish to work with.

- Did we mention testing??

---

## Coming From A Previous Release

STIG release always contains changes, it is highly recommended to review the new references and available variables. This has changed significantly since the initial ansible-lockdown release.
This is now compatible with python3 if it is found to be the default interpreter. This does come with pre-requisites which it configures the system accordingly.

Further details can be seen in the [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)

---

## Matching a security Level for STIG

It is possible to only run category 1, 2 or 3 controls for STIG.
This is managed using tags:

- CAT1
- CAT2
- CAT3

The control found in defaults main also need to reflect this as this control the testing that takes place if you are using the audit component.

ubtu24stig_cat1: true
ubtu24stig_cat2: true
ubtu24stig_cat3: true

---
## Requirements

**General:**

- Basic knowledge of Ansible, below are some links to the Ansible documentation to help get started if you are unfamiliar with Ansible

  - [Main Ansible documentation page](https://docs.ansible.com)
  - [Ansible Getting Started](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_getting_started.html)
  - [Tower User Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/index.html)
  - [Ansible Community Info](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/index.html)
- Functioning Ansible and/or Tower Installed, configured, and running. This includes all of the base Ansible/Tower configurations, needed packages installed, and infrastructure setup.
- Please read through the tasks in this role to gain an understanding of what each control is doing. Some of the tasks are disruptive and can have unintended consequences in a live production system. Also familiarize yourself with the variables in the defaults/main.yml file.

**Technical Dependencies:**

Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

- Access to download or add the goss binary and content to the system if using auditing
(other options are available on how to get the content to the system.)
- Python 3.10+ (Ubuntu 24.04 ships 3.12)
- Ansible 2.16.1+
- python3-apt (for the `apt` module - pre-installed on stock Ubuntu cloud images)

## Auditing

This can be turned on or off within the defaults/main.yml file with the variable run_audit. The value is false by default, please refer to the wiki for more details. The defaults file also populates the goss checks to check only the controls that have been enabled in the ansible role.

This is a much quicker, very lightweight, checking (where possible) config compliance and live/running settings.

A new form of auditing has been developed, by using a small (12MB) go binary called [goss](https://github.com/goss-org/goss) along with the relevant configurations to check. Without the need for infrastructure or other tooling.
This audit will not only check the config has the correct setting but aims to capture if it is running with that configuration also trying to remove [false positives](https://www.mindpointgroup.com/blog/is-compliance-scanning-still-relevant/) in the process.

Refer to [UBUNTU24-STIG-Audit](https://github.com/ansible-lockdown/UBUNTU24-STIG-Audit).

## Example Audit Summary

This is based on a vagrant image with selections enabled. e.g. No Gui or firewall.
Note: More tests are run during audit as we check config and running state.

```txt

ok: [default] => {
    "msg": [
        "The pre remediation results are: ['Total Duration: 5.454s', 'Count: 338, Failed: 47, Skipped: 5'].",
        "The post remediation results are: ['Total Duration: 5.007s', 'Count: 338, Failed: 46, Skipped: 5'].",
        "Full breakdown can be found in /var/tmp",
        ""
    ]
}

PLAY RECAP *******************************************************************************************************************************************
default                    : ok=270  changed=23   unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=140  rescued=0    ignored=0
```

## Role Variables

This role is designed that the end user should not have to edit the tasks themselves. All customizing should be done via the defaults/main.yml file or with extra vars within the project, job, workflow, etc.

## Tags

There are many tags available for added control precision. Each control has its own set of tags noting what level, what OS element it relates to, whether it's a patch or audit, and the rule number. Additionally, NIST references follow a specific conversion format for consistency and clarity.

### Conversion Format for NIST References:

  1. Standard Prefix:

    - All references are prefixed with "NIST".

  2. Standard Types:

    - "800-53" references are formatted as NIST800-53.
    - "800-53r5" references are formatted as NIST800-53R5 (with 'R' capitalized).
    - "800-171" references are formatted as NIST800-171.

  3. Details:

    - Section and subsection numbers use periods (.) for numeric separators.
    - Parenthetical elements are separated by underscores (_), e.g., IA-5(1)(d) becomes IA-5_1_d.
    - Subsection letters (e.g., "b") are appended with an underscore.
Below is an example of the tag section from a control within this role. Using this example, if you set your run to skip all controls with the tag CAT1, this task will be skipped. The opposite can also happen where you run only controls tagged with CAT1.

```sh
      tags:
      - UBTU-24-100030
      - CAT1
      - CCI-000197
      - SRG-OS-000074-GPOS-00042
      - NIST800-53R4_IA-5
```


## Community Contribution

Pull requests are accepted from approved contributors only, and issues are welcome from everyone.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the onboarding process, the rules, and the commit signing
requirements (GPG signature and Signed-off-by on every commit).

## Pipeline Testing

uses:

- ansible-core 2.16
- ansible collections - pulls in the latest version based on requirements file
- runs the audit using the devel branch
- This is an automated test that occurs on pull requests into devel
- self-hosted runners using OpenTofu

For running the molecule `default` scenario locally (converge, idempotency, and goss audit), see [molecule/README_Molecule_QuickStart.md](molecule/README_Molecule_QuickStart.md).
